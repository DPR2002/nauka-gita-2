        <h1>Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
        <p>
        [Intro]
        Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?<br>
        Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality<br>
        Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see<br>
        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
        Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low<br>
        Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 1]<br>
        Mama, just killed a man<br>
        Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
        Mama, life had just begun<br>
        But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
        Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry<br>
        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
        Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        Too late, my time has come<br>
        Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time<br>
        Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
        Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)<br>
        I don't wanna die<br>
        I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 3]<br>
        I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
        Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?<br>
        Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me<br>
        (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico<br>
        But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me<br>
        He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
        Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
        Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br>
        Bismillah! No, we will not let you go<br>
        (Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
        (Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go<br>
        (Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
        (Let me go) Will not let you go<br>
        (Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah<br>
        No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
        (Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go<br>
        Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 4]<br>
        So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
        So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
        Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!<br>
        Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here<br>
        <br>
        [Outro]<br>
        (Ooh)<br>
        (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)<br>
        Nothing really matters, anyone can see<br>
        Nothing really matters<br>
        Nothing really matters to me<br>
        Any way the wind blows<br>
